            We know that acquiring a Diabetic Alert Dog can be an expensive task, and this make it so
            families cannot afford them. We formed K94T1 for the single purpose of making it possible
            for more families can receive Diabetic Alert Dogs. While partnering exclusively with Heads
            Up Hounds (a company that uses only shelter/rescue dogs), we utilize multiple types of 
            fundraising to generate the money needed for the dogs.

                We know that acquiring a Diabetic Alert Dog can be an expensive task, and this make it so
                families cannot afford them. We formed K94T1 for the single purpose of making it possible
                for more families can receive Diabetic Alert Dogs. While partnering exclusively with Heads
                Up Hounds (a company that uses only shelter/rescue dogs), we utilize multiple types of 
                fundraising to generate the money needed for the dogs.
